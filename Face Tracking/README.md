## Face Tracking
This project comprised of a camera module fixed on a two axis pan tilt mechanism.It uses OpenCV to detect the user’s face and control the movement of the pan tilt using an arduino so that it always points to the user’s face. The complete pan-tilt structure was designed and made using 3D printing.
