## Quantum Computer Simulator
This project uses a python distribution called qiskit to run quantum circuits in a Raspberry Pi. The user can design a quantum circuit using the number of gates available and it can be run in the qiskit environment. The output of the execution can be viewed as a histogram in the simulator display.
